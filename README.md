CLI tool and GitHub Action for automatically discovering and validating Kustomize overlays with intelligent change detection.

## 📦 For Users

**Looking to use this in GitHub Actions?** → See the **[kustomize-build-check-action](https://github.com/michielvha/kustomize-build-check-action)** repository.

This repository contains the source code and build pipeline. The action repository provides a clean interface for GitHub Actions users.

## 📖 What It Does

Intelligently validates Kustomize configurations by:
- 🔍 Auto-discovering all Kustomize files and their dependencies
- 🧠 Smart testing based on what changed (bases → all overlays, overlays → just that one)
- ⚡ Helm chart support with `--enable-helm`
- 📊 Clear build results and error reporting

## 🔧 Architecture

See [design.md](design.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

**Repository Structure:**
- **Tool Repository** (this one): Go source, binaries, Docker images
- **Action Repository**: GitHub Action interface referencing GHCR images

**Release Pipeline:**
1. Push to `main` → GitVersion tags the repo
2. GoReleaser builds multi-platform binaries
3. Docker images built for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64
4. Published to GitHub Releases + GHCR

## 🛠️ Development

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.23+
- Docker (for testing containers)
- Kustomize CLI

### Building

```bash
# Build binary
go build -o kustomize-build-check ./cmd/action

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Build Docker image locally
docker build -f Dockerfile -t kustomize-build-check:dev .
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# Set environment variables (simulates GitHub Actions)
export INPUT_BASE-REF="HEAD~1"
export INPUT_ENABLE-HELM="true"
export INPUT_ROOT-DIR="."

# Run the binary
./kustomize-build-check
```

## 🚀 Release Process

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions using custom composite actions:

1. **Push to `main`** → Triggers [build-release.yml](.github/workflows/build-release.yml)
2. **GitVersion** → Creates semantic version tag
3. **GoReleaser** → Builds binaries for all platforms
4. **Docker** → Builds and pushes multi-arch images to GHCR
5. **Action Repo** → Update to reference new version (manual)

### Creating a Release

```bash
# Commit with conventional commit format
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push origin main

# Pipeline automatically:
# - Tags with GitVersion
# - Builds binaries
# - Publishes to GitHub Releases
# - Pushes Docker images to GHCR
```
